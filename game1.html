Right now, I hate Junkrat. He's a scrawny, impish explosives expert with a grenade lobbing Frag Launcher. His ultimate ability – a slow charging special attack that fills faster as you do damage and score kills – is a motorised, remote control tire bomb with a devastating area of effect. Put simply, he makes things blow up. Things like me and my team of disparate misfits, who, until Junkrat showed up, were seconds away from successfully defending the control point and winning the match.

That's Overwatch, a multiplayer character-based shooter in which 12 players compete across two teams to fulfil whatever objective the map asks of them. I say character-based rather than class-based, and that's an important distinction. Widowmaker and Hanzo are both snipers, but play completely differently. Mercy and Lucio are both healers, but one uses a staff that shoots healing energy, and the other, well, phat beats. Each character fits into a broader category, but is otherwise unique. Weapons, abilities, ultimates and even movement are all specific to that hero.</p>
                            <p>
It's a shooter then, but with a MOBA attitude to character design. To be clear: Overwatch isn't a MOBA. Rather, it's like if Heroes of the Storm went to Team Fortress 2's house party, and left without cleaning up after itself. There's no lane-pushing, AI creeps, item shopping or levelling. Objectives are straight out of the class-based shooter playbook, with points to attack and defend, payloads to push and hills to king. But characters have abilities, each reflective of their style and personality. And those abilities have cooldown timers, each different depending on their power and utility.</p>

Take Tracer, the peppy attack hero with the grating faux-cockney accent. Her basic ability, Blink, is a short range teleport that holds three charges, each on a three second cooldown. Her more powerful move, Recall, rewinds her to the health, ammo and position she was three seconds before. It's perfect for extricating yourself from a dangerous fight, but takes 12 seconds to recharge.</p>
<p>
There are characters who improve map visibility, soak up incoming damage with shields, or throw out armour for teammates to pick up. There are characters who lay traps, or debuff or stun enemies. There are characters who use a jetpack, teleport long distances, or boost movement speed for every teammate within an area of effect. It's a wide and varied roster with a plethora of styles and abilities.
</p>
<p>
Balancing that, some systems are more streamlined than you'd expect from a class-based shooter. Only a couple of heroes carry multiple weapons, but even that is mostly a choice between attack and utility. Only some heroes have an alternate fire mode. Even beyond specific loadouts, there's no ammo management. Most guns need to be reloaded, but they have an unlimited ammo pool to draw upon. There's still plenty of complexity, though, and, by using abilities, Overwatch feels distinct from its competitors.</p>
<p>
I particularly love how varied the movement is between characters. Not just Tracer's Blink, but also Genji's vertical scaling, Lucio's wallrun, Widowmaker's grappling hook and, most of all, Mercy's glide. Mercy, Overwatch's medic, is the perfect example of how every aspect of a character can, in the best cases, support a specific style. Alone, she's vulnerable and slow – easily ambushed and dispatched. But, with line-of-sight to a teammate, she can spread her wings and fly towards them. It's fun to do, and also reinforces the symbiotic partnership between healer and healed: Mercy needs her teammates as much as they need her. It's masterful design.</p>
                <p>
Overwatch runs beautifully. Its options are highly customisable, and I'm yet to experience any frame rate drops playing on Ultra settings, on a 1920x1200 monitor with a GTX 970. As for online performance, the only lag I've experienced was isolated to a few hours on a single evening – probably more the fault of my sluggish home connection than Blizzard's servers. And despite some predictable post-release downtime, servers have remained steady across launch week. It's nice to have a new multiplayer game perform so reliably.
                </p>
                <p>
As good as it is, there are some rough patches to be found underneath Blizzard's peerless polish. For that reason, Team Fortress 2 remains my favourite class-based shooter. Its characters feel more intricately woven, with a wider range of utility. Overwatch, however, comes in a pretty close second, and with the benefit of not carrying years of experimental baggage. It's microtransactions are better, too, thanks to them being purely cosmetic. Of course, that's likely in part to the fact the game isn't free to begin with.

Crucially, though, unless Blizzard do something drastically wrong, Overwatch is only going to get better. It'll need new maps eventually, preferably before the current 12 get stale, and there are plenty of tweaks and alterations that it could benefit from. Whatever happens in the future, what Overwatch offers right now is an excellent start.
