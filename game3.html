                            <h3>Ori and The Blind Forest</h3> 
                
                <div class="fancy-box">
                <div class="fancy_box_body"><p>This is a metroidvania with challenging platforming puzzles and some combat.  </p></div>
                </div>
                
                                <p>
Ori and the Blind Forest is a pool of painted light in constant motion, where layers upon layers of animation recede deep into each frame. 3D effects, such as the surface of a lake changing perspective as you dive deeper, subtly add volume to sparkling 2D spaces. In its dungeons, complementary colors light ice caves and lava flows with the striking clash of pulp fantasy illustrations. It’s one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played.</p>
<p>
It’s also very fun, and pretty difficult. The curiously calming (and fantastic) music seems more suited for a city builder, but smartly so: piano, winds, and strings relieve the stress of playing Ori and lull me into a cool-headed space, where I can routinely die by spike pit and keep going. I never wanted to stop.</p>
                            <p>
Ori is classified as a metroidvania, a genre of 2D platforming action games where new abilities are typically picked up along the way and backtracking—often to find formerly unreachable secrets—is a necessary part of playing. Ori can easily be compared to Metroid in that respect: It’s an intricate, winding network of passages, each with hidden areas, treacherous platforming puzzles, and projectile-spewing enemies. It comes with the genre’s captivating exploration, but also the minor flaw that such openness can lead to pointless excursions into places you’re not supposed to be yet. By some accidental luck, I actually made it to the entrance of the final dungeon long before I was supposed to, and then had to turn back and try not to die as I escaped without the abilities I was supposed to have reached the area with.</p>
                
<p>
Despite the comparisons to Metroid, though, Ori is hardly ‘retro.' Just as Ori's art doesn't emulate Metroid's pixels, its design is not a total copy, focusing far more on interesting movement than shooting. The basic attack is a fairly ineffectual barrage of homing projectiles, and can only be made faster and stronger. I was a little disappointed when I realized I wasn’t going to discover more interesting projectiles, but with no aiming to speak of, Ori can focus on fun stuff like jumping, wall jumping, double jumping, super jumping, smashing into the ground, swimming, climbing, floating, and dashing—phew.</p>
<p>
Others I’ve spoken to are not fond of Ori’s save system, but I like it. Using the energy resource, which is fairly plentiful, Ori can save in any safe place. Early on, when I wasn’t in the habit of paying attention to my energy reserve and saving after every accomplishment, it was mildly frustrating: I’d solve a difficult bit of maneuvering and then die later from some stupid mistake without having stopped to record my progress. Once I was in the habit, though, the system is a nice modern bit of design that acts as counter-balance to Ori’s difficulty. If something is giving you trouble, you can save just before it and try and try again until you succeed.</p>
<p>
There are a few places, however, where you can’t save at all. Ori’s three dungeons (for lack of a better word) each have timed chase segments which must be completed in one go. They’re a series of challenges which come fast and must be memorized—every time I got a little further, I died trying to figure out what I needed to do next, and then I memorized that and got further, and died again. They are frustrating, and I love them. Mastery is intrinsically enjoyable—it’s the entire premise of Super Meat Boy, which I also love—and I don’t mind barking at my screen when it feels cruel, so long as it’s not too cruel. It wasn’t. I never spent more than 20 minutes or so on one segment.</p>
<p>
I did find these end-of-dungeon difficulty spikes surprising given the forgiving save system and marketing that focuses on a “deeply emotional” story (which is told in beautifully-animated segments, but never quite gets better than the sweet and tragic opening). This is not the sort of game that lets less-skilled players skip the tough bits to get on with the pretty art, which isn’t a knock on Ori, but something you ought to be aware of. It’s better seen than described, so I’ve embedded a video of the first of these timed segments above. It's classic a 'die until you memorize this' design, but not unfair.</p>
<p>
But go and grab a controller, because it’s worth it. I clocked about eight hours with Ori, and that’s without hundred-percenting it (if that’s something you’re into, copy your save before you beat it, because you can’t go back after entering the final dungeon). I loved nearly all of it. It’s beautiful, it’s hard, and while it takes some of its greatness from console classics, it shines with its own identity.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                <p>Challenging and gorgeous, Ori is a classic platforming genre modernized and done strikingly well. Save often.</p>
